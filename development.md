# How To Start Contributing

*Or, how I made 20 features and no fixes*


## First steps


### 1. Have a plan!

So, you want to contribute. But why?
Maybe you already have an idea, probably you do, and this is good.
However, it is good to know what is possible, and what **you** can and want to work on.
There are quite a bunch of things you can actually make:

- Bugfixes
- Game Features
- UI Interfaces
- Maps
  - Stations (Main Maps)
  - Ruins
  - Shuttles
- Sprites
- Developer Tools

Some of these are more developer/'coder' related, while others are more artistic, but both are equally as important in developing a game.

Try to start small, especially if you're completely new. And don't be shy to ask for assistance.

### 2. Get the tools

Now before we can dive into the great world of rogue pixels, mapping errors, or runtimes, we will need some tools.

Space Station 13 has a quite large environment nowadays, comparatively to other BYOND games. This has led to development of a lot of additional tools and ways to deal with the growing complexity.
We'll shortly go over those.

So.. what do we actually need?

| Tool | Required? | What Is It For? | Where To Get It? |
| ---- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| BYOND | Required | Compiling/Building and executing the code, playing the game | http://www.byond.com/download/ |
| Visual Studio Code | Required | Editing the code, also has support features for building, debugging, testing and more | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |
| VSCode Extensions | Recommended | Enabling the aforementioned features | \<TODO: add sublink\> |
| StrongDMM | Optional | Creating/Editing/Viewing Maps (Mapping) | https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM#how-to-use |
| PaintDotNet | Optional | Creating/Editing sprites/icons | https://www.getpaint.net/ |
| Audacity | Optional | Creating/Editing sounds | https://www.audacityteam.org/ |

Please note that there might be programs better suited for some of these tasks, however some of those are either paid software, or harder to get. The ones listed here are 100% free and will work well enough.
