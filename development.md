# How To Start Contributing

*Or, how I made 20 features and no fixes*

This page will guide you through getting set up with tools and the necessary basic knowledge to partake in the development of our codebase.
It is aimed at complete beginners.

## First steps


### 1. Have a plan!

So, you want to contribute. But why?
Maybe you already have an idea, probably you do, and this is good.
However, it is good to know what is possible, and what **you** can and want to work on.
There are quite a bunch of things you can actually make:

- Bugfixes
- Game Features
- UI Interfaces
- Maps
  - Stations (Main Maps)
  - Ruins
  - Shuttles
- Sprites
- Developer Tools

Some of these are more developer/'coder' related, while others are more artistic, but both are equally as important in developing a game.

Try to start small, especially if you're completely new. And don't be shy to ask for assistance.

### 2. Get the tools

Now before we can dive into the great world of rogue pixels, mapping errors, or runtimes, we will need some tools.

Space Station 13 has a quite large environment nowadays, comparatively to other BYOND games. This has led to development of a lot of additional tools and ways to deal with the growing complexity.
We'll shortly go over those.

So.. what do we actually need?

| Tool | Required? | What Is It For? | Where To Get It? |
| ---- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| BYOND | Required | - Compiling/Building and executing the code<br/> - Playing the game | http://www.byond.com/download/ |
| GitKraken | Required | - Downloading and updating your local copy of the repository<br/> - Uploading updates to us | https://www.gitkraken.com/ |
| Visual Studio Code | Required | Editing the code, also has support features for building, debugging, testing and more | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |
| VSCode Extensions | Recommended | Enabling the aforementioned features | \<TODO: add sublink\> |
| StrongDMM | Optional | Creating/Editing/Viewing Maps (Mapping) | https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM#how-to-use |
| PaintDotNet | Optional | Creating/Editing sprites/icons | https://www.getpaint.net/ |
| Audacity | Optional | Creating/Editing sounds | https://www.audacityteam.org/ |

> Please note that there might be programs better suited for some of these tasks, however some of those are either paid software, or harder to get.
> The ones listed here are 100% free and will work well enough.
