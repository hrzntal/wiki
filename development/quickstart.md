## The tools of the trade
This section will have recommendations for programs to use.
Do check the differences between them as that is out of scope for this guide.

### Git
A very common VCS (Version Control System)
- Git (CLI/Basic GUI)
- GitKraken (GUI, GitHub Support)

### IDE / Editor
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
- ~~JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA~~ (No DreamMaker plugin yet, coming soon)

### Mapping
- StrongDMM

### Spriting
- PaintDotNET (Fully free, precompiled)
- Aseprite (Free, but must be compiled manually from source)

### Audio
- Audacity (Free, but dated interface)
- FL Studio (Paid software, might be overkill)
