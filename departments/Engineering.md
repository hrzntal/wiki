# Engineering

Engineering is comprised of the following roles.

-Chief Engineer
-Engineer
-Atmospheric Technician

## [Chief Engineer](/departments/Engineering/ChiefEngineer)
![generic_ce.webp](/jobs/generic_ce.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

Equal rank with all other non-captain Heads of Staff. Oversees the maintenance of the station, with authority over Station Engineers and Atmospheric Technicians. Authority over Telecoms maintenance.

<br>
<br>
<br>

- **Required Knowlage:** How the telecommunications, atmospherics, solars and the supermatter work. How to deconstruct an APC.
- **Round start to-do list:** First Establish communications with your department, then ensure power is supplied to the station via Supermatter or solars. Finally, make sure that Atmospherics round start tasks are completed.
- **Main Tasks:** Making sure your Engineers are keeping the Station/Ship functional. Make sure Atmospherics is functional. Makes sure to delegate and communicate to ensure timely responses to life threatening engineering emergencies. Teach and assist new or overwhelmed engineer staff.
- **Main Problems:** The station is bound to have explosions or at least minor holes in it during the shift. Learn how to tackle the exploded telecommunications -situation and you'll be irreplaceable in more than one shift, guaranteed. With the SM in your department, you have the key to the fastest emergency shuttle call in the west, Don't use it.

## [Engineer](/departments/Engineering/Engineer)
![generic_ce.webp](/jobs/generic_ce.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

Fixing the station, one mouse chewed wire, and one gaping hole to vacuum at a time. Engineers are responsible for fixing damage, building machines and equipment, and most importantly, starting the Supermatter. Listen to the Chief Engineer's orders, the needs of the station, and the assistants crying over common about the Supermatter stability being at 25%, how it's your fault, and to call the shuttle.

<br>
<br>

- **Required knowledge:** Basic Repair knowledge, a basic Supermatter setup, how to wire solars, how to use and build SMESs and APCs, how to build machinery and computers,
- **Round-start to-do list:** Communicate with other engineering staff who's starting the SM, Who's wiring solars. Resist the urge to live in the very few Engineering hardsuits your department has.
- **Main tasks:** Try to maintain station or ship integrity. Respond to requests over comms, taking jobs in order of importance, or danger. Engineering also needs to keep the Supermatter happy, or make it less angry when it gets uppity.
- **Main problems:** You're the second line of defence against the vacuume of space, with the first being the hull you're supposed to keep in place. You have a hand in the Supermatter, and ensuring it doesn't remove you and your neighboring departments from this plane of existence. You have the means to get into anything, and must have the self control to not.

## [Atmospheric Technician](/departments/Engineering/AtmosTech)
![generic_ce.webp](/jobs/generic_ce.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

Atmospheric Technicians keep the station capable of sustaining life. The atmosphere that sustains organic life is incredibly fickle and can change, or even vanish in a moment, killing or critically injuring most crew in seconds. The Atmospheric Technician's life is one of extremes, either you have nothing to do, and must rely on gas mixing or personal projects to keep busy, or, half the station is uninhabitable, and you're spread thin across the station trying to keep as many places habitable as possible.


<br>

- **Required knowledge:** How pipes work, how to fight fires, how to use the Air Alarm interface, how to use the RPD, how to setup thermo machines with cooling loops, basic turbine setup, and how to refill an area from vacuum.
- **Round-start to-do list:** Ensure distro is loaded to a **safe** pressure, Ensure Thermomachines have functional and pressurized cooling looops, and start the turbine if engineering's power situation isn't ideal.
- **Main tasks:** Keep the air breathable, mix new and useful gases, fight fires, help the engineers when they inevitably cause a delamination.
- **Main problems:** It's very easy to ruin Distro with a bad pipe placement, It's even more easy to light a fire trying to clean that accident up. On top of this, each breach will give you something to do. Space, events, and people will fight to make sure you have to run from one side of the station to the other, often because a very small area lost pressure, or has a bad air mix.
