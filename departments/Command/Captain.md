You are the Captain, the top of the Chain of Command. It is your duty to ensure the stability and productivity of the station, as well as carrying out directives from CentCom.

You should have experience of all Heads of Staff jobs. At round start, take the Nuclear Disk with you, call the Heads to report in and keep checking in from time to time on what needs to be done and who should do it.

Bare minimum requirements: Secure dat fukken disk, secure the pinpointer, secure or burn the safe code (in your pocket) for the spare Captain's ID. Only use your authority when it is required, the Heads of Staff are there for a reason.
