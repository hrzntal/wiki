The Commanding Officer with authority over the entire station. Eventually dies and has the Head of Personnel take over. Limited only by style - Just don't forget the disk. The only position that can issue death warrants without a trial.

- **Required Knowlage:** How the AI works, What other Heads of Staff should be doing.
- **Round start to-do list:** Check in with your Heads of Staff. Secure the nuclear authorization disk and give the pinpointer to someone trustworthy for maximum safety.
- **Main Tasks:** Making sure your heads of staff are doing their jobs, figure out what needs to be done and delegate. Keep the disk close to you.
- **Main Problems:** Many high-risk items start in your office or directly in your possession. And your shiny gold id card is coveted by almost every troublemaker. Expect many attempts to be made on your life for these things.
