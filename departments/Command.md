The Commanding Officer with authority over the entire station. Eventually dies and has the Head of Personnel take over. Limited only by style - Just don't forget the disk. The only position that can issue death warrants without a trial.

## Head of Personnel

- **Main tasks:** Try to keep the crew as safe as possible. Keep your officers from degenerating to shitcurity when things get rough.
