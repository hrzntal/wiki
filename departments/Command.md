## Captain
![generic_captain.webp](/jobs/generic_captain.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

The Commanding Officer with authority over the entire station. Eventually dies and has the Head of Personnel take over. Limited only by style - Just don't forget the disk. The only position that can issue death warrants without a trial.

<br>
<br>
<br>

- **Required Knowlage:** How the AI works, What other Heads of Staff should be doing.
- **Round start to-do list:** Check in with your Heads of Staff. Secure the nuclear authorization disk and give the pinpointer to someone trustworthy for maximum safety.
- **Main Tasks:** Making sure your heads of staff are doing their jobs, figure out what needs to be done and delegate. Keep the disk close to you.
- **Main Problems:** Many high-risk items start in your office or directly in your possession. And your shiny gold id card is coveted by almost every troublemaker. Expect many attempts to be made on your life for these things.

## Head of Personnel
![generic_hop.webp](/jobs/generic_hop.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

Authority over all civil and supply departments, including the Janitor, Chef, Barman, Clown, Mime, Assistants, Quartermaster, Shaft Miners, Lawyers, Chaplain, Curator, Botanists and Cargo Techs.

The Head of Personnel can either be a Godsend or worse than a banana-flinging clown for the station. He can also savor the prestige or feel shackled to the ID computer. If you find yourself wearing teal, make the most of it by doing your job correctly.

<br>

- **Required knowledge:** How to use the Identification Console. A rough idea of how access is distributed throughout the station. What Cargo, Kitchen, Hydroponics and the Janitor should be doing.
- **Round-start to-do list:** Stay at your desk for at least the first 10 minutes to manage the shift-start rush.
- **Main tasks:** Manage IDs.
- **Main problems:** Your department (the civil department) doesn't ever acknowledge you as their boss. It's your duty to make that a thing of the past!

## Head of Secuirty
![generic_hos.webp](/jobs/generic_hos.webp =100x){.align-left .noblur}

Equal rank with all other non-captain Heads of Staff. Although he technically has access, other Heads may deny him from entering their domains. Usually withheld from a promotion to acting Captain if other Heads are available, however in times of crisis he may usually force himself into the position as acting Captain to better control the crisis. Oversees security matters with authority over Security Officers, the Warden and the Detective. Expected to detain and handle those who endanger the station, including other heads of staff, and in some cases, the Captain.

- **Required knowledge:** How to use security equipment, a firm grasp on Space Law, and rough idea of what kind of threats the station will have to face and how to deal with them.
- **Round-start to-do list:** Get your officers to report in, if they don't, remind them that the security force doesn't work without teamwork and communication, and have them demoted if they're still acting like a lone mute wolf.
- **Main tasks:** Try to keep the crew as safe as possible. Keep your officers from degenerating to shitcurity when things get rough.
- **Main problems:** Assistants pushing each other is not a big problem, you shouldn't have to spend much time on those. Focus on the big fish instead.

## Research Director

<br>
<br>

- **Required knowledge:** Know how R&D works, how to upgrade machines, how xenobiology works, how telescience works and how robotics work.

- **Main tasks:** Check the Crew Monitoring Console from time to time for dead/dying people.
- **Main problems:** Medical jobs are a common choice for new players seeking a relevant role. So when not absent, dead, or traitorous, expect your staff to need constant babysitting and guidance on how to perform even basic treatments.
